# Turtle Race | BETA 

**Disclaimer:** Please note that this project is still in its first beta stage. It is nowhere near complete and there are many goals and aspirations for this project for the future. The code is subject to change.

## Brief Description

This project is currently only a simple program that uses the Python Turtle module to race 6 turtles and let the user predict which turtle is going to win. 

## Features that will be integrated in the next update:


1. Let the user pick what is racing:
	1. Bikers
	2. Turtles 
	3. Rabbits 
2. Let the user pick how many objects are racing.
3. Integrate a points / credit system.
